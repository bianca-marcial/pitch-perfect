This project is the first deliverable for Udacity's iOS Development course

## App Details:

This application allows the user to record his or her voice and then playback the recording with different types of effects. Right now the application allows you to play the audio in 6 different effects and is built so that you can add more effects seamlessly.

## Future Steps:

1. New UI Design
2. Ability to store more than one recording and playback more than one recording.
3. Ability to add or remove any effects you want to use.
